Recalling the equations:
\begin{eqnarray}
v_i (t) & = & \left[ D_i/\pi_i - e_i + e_i s/m \right]^+ \label{vacancy}\\
\frac{de_i}{dt} & = & v_i m  - e_i s + \left[ D_i/\pi_i - e_i \right]^-\label{employmentchange},
\end{eqnarray}
Assuming a time-independent signal at zero vacancies, the change in employment becomes
\begin{equation}
    0=[\sigma(1+CG_0)(1+\xi)-e(1+s/m)]^+
\end{equation}
It follows that vacancies are only posted when 
\begin{equation}
CG_0>\frac{e(1+s/m)}{\sigma (1+\xi)}-1
\end{equation}
When $G_0=0$, vacancies will still be posted when 
\begin{equation}
    \frac e\sigma>\frac{(1+\xi)}{1+s/m}.
\end{equation}
If we assume no surplus of labor, or $\xi=0$, vacancies are not posted as $s\rightarrow 0$, or when separations are negligible relative to the matching rate. A larger surplus also counteracts the separation rate.

The equilibrium employment level, or whe $de/dt=0$ under two conditions. The first condition, when the target firm size is the current firm size and the third term is zero, the equilibrium firm size is $e=vm/s$, or
\begin{equation}
    e=v\frac{e}{\sigma(1+\xi)-e}.
\end{equation}
We can plug this term into the definition of the matching rate, $m=Ku$ to get an equilibrium matching rate
\begin{equation}
    K_{eq}=es/vu
\end{equation}
